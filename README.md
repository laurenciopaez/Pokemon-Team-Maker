# Pokemon Team maker

<h2>This is a website to practise a more advance design and API connections</h2>
<h2>It has 3 main parts. The log in, that it is also the landing page, a register form page with some simple javascript authentication and a main page divided in two parts. One with your pokemon team and one with all pokemons</h2>
<h2>I didn't make any server api on this project, so i decided to use json-server for the api requests. This json-server is the one that handle the requests to add, modify or delete info from a json file that acts as a database</h2>
<h2>it works well but have some issues with update on real time the information -> learned later that i should make the requests on the actions of the redux. So it will be a task to update on the future</h2>
<h2>It was created using react-bootstrap and redux. Also, i tried using the nav cookies and it works very well. With a javascript logic that prevents the user of access the main page without log in. </h2>
